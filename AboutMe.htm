<h1>About Me - Sarah Bridges</h1>
<img src="IMG_1543.jpg" alt="Sarah Bridges Photo" class="center">
<p> I live in Janesville, WI with my partner, Ryan, and our 2 year old puppy, Ollie. I completed my Associates Degree in 2018 at the University of Wisconsin Rock-County (now part of UW Whitewater), where Ryan and I met. Upon graduation, I started a job as a call center agent at Grainger, which set me on a path in the corporate world. I took a management position in the call center in 2019, and then in 2021 I started in my current role as an Employee Relations Specialist in Human Resources. To fulfill the Bachelors degree requirement of my role, I enrolled in the Applied Social Sciences program in Fall of 2022. 
<p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy creative writing, yoga, and reading. Lately I have become more interested in non-fiction, and my favorite book I most recently read was the 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene </p>
