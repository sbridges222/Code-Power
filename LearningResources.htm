<h2>Learning Resources - Implicit Bias & Intersectionality</h2>
<h3>What is implicit bias and why is it important?</h3>
<p>Implicit bias refers to the unconscious attitudes, stereotypes, and associations that influence our perceptions, actions, and decisions, often without our awareness. These biases contribute to societal inequities as they can lead to disparate treatment of people based on their race, gender, age, or other characteristics.</p>
<h3>Do I have implicit bias?</h3>
<p>Yes, everyone has implicit bias to some degree, regardless of their demographic background or conscious beliefs. Bias is a result of the innate function of the human brain to look for patterns and associations, and they are formed unconsciously through repeated exposure to stereotypes and societal messages. Explore your unconscious associations with <a href=https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html">Harvard's interactive Implicit Association activity</a>.</p>
<h3>Is it possible to eliminate implicit bias entirely?</h3>
<p>No, implicit bias is an involuntary function of the brain. The harmful effects of implicit bias can be lessened, however, with increased awareness, self-reflection, and adoption of inclusive practices on an individual and institutional level.</p>

<h3>What is intersectionality and why is it important?</h3>
<p>Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how individual experiences of privilege and marginalization are created by overlapping social identies (such as race, gender, sexuality, and disability). This offers a more nuanced and effective way of addressing complex social inequities.</p>
